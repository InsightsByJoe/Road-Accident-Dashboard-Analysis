# Road Accident Dashboard Analysis

![Road Accident Dashboard](path/to/dashboard_image.png)

## Purpose

The **Road Accident Dashboard Analysis** project provides an interactive and user-friendly dashboard designed to help analyze road accident data. The primary goal is to offer insights into various accident-related factors such as vehicle type, casualty severity, road type, surface condition, and light conditions. By presenting the data visually, this dashboard allows traffic safety analysts, city planners, and decision-makers to better understand and interpret accident trends, helping in formulating strategies to reduce casualties.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard:
- **Total Casualties**: 41,788 casualties, with **serious** (14.2%) and **slight** (84.1%) injuries dominating over fatalities.
- **Vehicle Type**: **Cars** are involved in the majority of accidents (79.8%).
- **Accidents by Road Type**: **Single carriageways** have the highest casualty rates.
- **Surface Condition**: Most accidents happen on **dry surfaces**, challenging the assumption that wet conditions are more dangerous.
- **Lighting Conditions**: Accidents are more frequent during **daylight** than during **dark** conditions.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Dashboard**
- Visualize accident data across different dimensions like **vehicle type**, **road type**, **surface condition**, and **light conditions**.
- Use the **filter panel** to narrow down data based on:
  - Accident Year (2021, 2022)
  - **Area Type** (Urban vs. Rural)
  - **Date of Accident** (Select a specific period or view all data)

### 2. **Dynamic Charts and Graphs**
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Compare accidents involving cars, buses, motorcycles, and bicycles.
- **Casualties by Light Condition**: Understand how different light conditions (daylight vs. dark) affect accident rates.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: See how road infrastructure (single carriageway, dual carriageway) influences accident severity.
- **Surface Condition**: Assess how road surface conditions (wet, dry, snow) impact accident frequency.

### 3. **Excel Integration**
- The dashboard leverages **Excel's powerful visualization tools** to provide dynamic data exploration.
- **Pivot Tables** and **Power Query** are used to clean, filter, and summarize data efficiently.
