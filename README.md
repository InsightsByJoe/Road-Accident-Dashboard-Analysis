# üöó Road Accident Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents in Great Britain, focusing on key metrics such as total casualties, vehicle types involved, road conditions, and environmental factors. The goal of the analysis is to identify trends and patterns to help inform road safety measures and policies.

The dashboard visualizes fatal, serious, and slight casualties across different conditions, including vehicle type, road surface, light conditions, and accident area (rural vs urban). The data is presented in a clear and interactive format, making it accessible for decision-makers, road safety authorities, and researchers.

## Data Sources
1. **Primary Data**: The primary data for this analysis was sourced from Wikipedia‚Äôs "Reported Road Casualties in Great Britain". You can read more about this data from the link below:
   - [Reported Road Casualties Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain)
   
2. **Dataset Used**: The actual dataset used for this analysis is available here:

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Excel was used for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualizing the results. You can download Microsoft Excel [here](https://microsoft.com).

## Process
### 1. Data Loading and Inspection
   - The data was loaded into Excel from the provided Google Sheets dataset.
   - I inspected the dataset for inconsistencies, missing data, and overall structure to understand the content and scope.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - **Duplicates**: Removed any duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
   - **Missing Values**: Where applicable, missing values were filled with averages or removed based on the context of the data.
   - **Formatting**: Standardized date formats and numerical data (e.g., casualty numbers).

### 3. Data Analysis
   - **Casualty Breakdown**: Data was categorized by vehicle type, road type, surface condition, light condition, and area (urban/rural).
   - **Yearly Trends**: Line charts were created to compare the current year's casualties against the previous year to observe trends.
   - **Casualties by Area and Condition**: Pie charts were used to depict casualties based on light conditions (daylight vs dark) and area (urban vs rural).

### 4. Findings
   - **Total Casualties**: There were a total of 41,788 casualties, with 7,135 fatal casualties and 5,931 serious casualties.
   - **Road Type Impact**: The highest number of casualties occurred on single carriageway roads (around 309.7K), indicating a significant risk factor.
   - **Vehicle Types**: Cars accounted for the majority of casualties (79.8%), while bicycles had the lowest with 1,032 casualties.
   - **Light Conditions**: More casualties were reported during daylight (305.0K) compared to dark conditions (112.9K).

### 5. Recommendations
   - **Increase Road Safety on Single Carriageways**: As the highest casualties are seen on single carriageways, this calls for improved road safety measures, such as better signage, speed controls, and awareness campaigns.
   - **Urban vs Rural Focus**: More focus should be given to rural areas, where casualties appear higher compared to urban settings.
   - **Vehicle-Specific Measures**: Tailored safety measures for different vehicle types (e.g., cars, bicycles) could help mitigate risks.

### 6. Limitations
   - **Data Scope**: This analysis is based on a specific dataset from Great Britain. Results may not generalize to other regions or countries.
   - **Missing Data**: Some casualty data may be underreported, especially for minor incidents or accidents that were not recorded by official channels.

### 7. Conclusion
   This project provides valuable insights into road accidents and casualty trends in Great Britain. By analyzing various factors like road type, vehicle type, and light conditions, we can develop targeted safety measures that can help reduce casualties and save lives.
